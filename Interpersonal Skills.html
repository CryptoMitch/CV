      <h1>Additional Skills</h1>
      <h3>Here are the interpersonal skills that I've gained over the years.</h3>
          <h4>Customer Service</h4>
          <p> I have gained 10 years equivelant of customer service experience. This has happened in various ways. During Highschool I worked at Caltex (2 years), Harvey Norman (x Months), The Karratha International Hotel (x Months) and The Icon Karratha (x Months, but has since closed down). Also in my job as a Youth Minister I had to speak to nervour parents about youth camps, and convince them that their beloved child will okay. That is a transferable skill that can benefit your business, when convincing customers on a approach contrary to their preference.</p>

          <h4>Teaching difficult concepts</h4>
          <p> Software Development is full of technical concepts, and often the people who know the technical concept don't know how to explain it to others. During the 6 years that I worked as a Youth Minister I was required to explain difficult theological concepts to children and teenagers on a weekly basis. I've learnt the skill of boiling a concept down to it's simplest part and combining that with illustrations to explain concepts simply and clearly.</p>

          <h4>Public Speaking</h4>
          <p> I am comfortable speaking in front of crowds. In my most recent job I would teach weekly in front of groups ranging from 10, 40 and even 100 people. The largest crowd I have spoken in front of was as Head Boy in high school in front of 900 Students and Teachers. More recently I have spoken in front of 170 people, where I gave a 30 minute speech.</p>

          <h4>Leading Teams</h4>
          <p>I have 3 years experience leading mixed age and gender teams ranging in size from 5-15 people on the team. I have learnt how to communicate well in a group and ensure that each member is heard, and that in the end the best idea is implemented, with duties being delegated to the appropriate people. I have learnt the hard way how to manage team expectations and prevent burn out.</p>

          <h4>Graphic Design</h4>
          <p> I have an excellent understanding of Canva and have made upwards of 250 designs using their platform. I've done this for my job in Youth Ministry, my youtube channel, my shopify stores and of course web development. I also have a basic understanding of Photoshop, but am willing to learn more.</p>

          <h4>German (A2 level)</h4>
          <p> I lived in Austria for 6 months and studied German, giving me the A2 proficiency. Which is level 2 of 6.</p>
